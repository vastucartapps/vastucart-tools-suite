            "answer": "Manglik Dosha (also called Mangal Dosha or Kuja Dosha) occurs when Mars is placed in the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 7th, 8th, or 12th house from Lagna, Moon, or Venus. It is believed to cause challenges in marriage and relationships due to Mars's aggressive energy."

            "answer": "Yes, a Manglik can marry a non-Manglik, especially if there are cancellation factors in the chart. Additionally, if the Manglik effect is mild or if proper remedies like Kumbh Vivah are performed, the marriage can be successful. Many astrologers also suggest that the effect diminishes after age 28."

            "answer": "Common remedies include: Kumbh Vivah (symbolic marriage to a pot/tree before actual marriage), wearing Red Coral gemstone, chanting Mangal mantras, Hanuman worship on Tuesdays, donating red items, and fasting on Tuesdays. Consult an astrologer for personalized remedies."

      "title": "About Bhagyodaya (Rise of Fortune)",
      "description": "Bhagyodaya (भाग्योदय) is a Sanskrit term meaning 'Rise of Fortune' or 'Dawn of Luck'. In Vedic numerology, it refers to specific years in your life when cosmic energies align to support your success and prosperity.",
      "whatIsTitle": "What is Bhagyodaya Year?",
      "whatIsDescription": "Your Bhagyodaya Year is calculated by combining your Birth Day Number with your Life Path Number. This reveals the age at which your fortune is destined to peak. Multiple fortune years occur throughout life, with varying intensities based on personal year cycles, planetary returns, and pinnacle phases.",
      "howItWorksTitle": "How the Calculation Works",
      "howItWorksDescription": "We analyze your birth date to determine Life Path, Birth Day, and (optionally) Destiny numbers. The primary Bhagyodaya age is the sum of Birth Day and Life Path numbers. We also calculate Pinnacle cycles, Challenge cycles, Saturn Returns (age 29, 58), Jupiter cycles (every 12 years), and Personal Year patterns to give you a comprehensive fortune map.",
      "componentsTitle": "Key Components Analyzed",
      "component1": "Primary Bhagyodaya Age - Your main fortune peak year",
      "component2": "Pinnacle Cycles - Four major life phases with unique opportunities",

    "faq": {
      "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
      "q1": "What if I've already passed my Bhagyodaya Year?",
      "a1": "Don't worry! Your primary Bhagyodaya is just the first major fortune peak. Life has multiple fortune years at different intensities. Check the Fortune Years tab to see upcoming peaks. Each 9-year cycle brings new opportunities aligned with your personal year number.",
      "q2": "How accurate is this calculation?",
      "a2": "The calculations are based on traditional Vedic numerology formulas. While numerology provides valuable guidance, it should be used alongside practical planning. Think of fortune years as times when cosmic support is stronger - but action is still required to manifest results.",
      "q3": "What are Pinnacles and Challenges?",
      "a3": "Pinnacles are four major life phases, each with a specific theme and opportunities. They're calculated from your birth date and Life Path Number. Challenges run parallel to Pinnacles and represent karmic lessons you must learn during each phase. Mastering your current challenge accelerates your growth.",
      "q4": "How should I prepare for my Bhagyodaya Year?",
      "a4": "Build skills and resources in the years leading up to your fortune peak. Clear karmic debts, strengthen relationships, and position yourself for opportunities. During the Bhagyodaya year itself, take bold action, start new ventures, and make major decisions you've been postponing."

      "a1": "While not the only factor, numerology provides a framework for selecting names with harmonious vibrations. Many families find that numerologically compatible names feel more natural and create positive energy. The name is a lifelong gift - choosing one with care adds an extra layer of intention.",
      "q2": "Can I use a name that's not in the suggestions?",
      "a2": "Absolutely! Our suggestions are a starting point. You can use our Name Correction tool to analyze any name you're considering. Enter the name to see its numerological value and check compatibility with your family's numbers.",
      "q3": "What if parents have incompatible numbers?",
      "a3": "Even when parents have different numerological profiles, there are always harmonizing numbers that work well with both. Our algorithm finds these bridges, ensuring the child's name creates balance rather than friction within the family dynamic.",
      "q4": "Should the starting letter match specific numbers?",
      "a4": "In Pythagorean numerology, each letter has a numerical value. Starting letters set the initial vibration of a name. While not mandatory, choosing a starting letter that corresponds to a favorable number can enhance the name's positive energy."

      "a1": "Add all digits of your house/flat number together until you get a single digit (1-9). For example, flat 42 = 4+2 = 6. For 12A, convert A=1, so 1+2+1 = 4. Our calculator does this automatically.",
      "q2": "What if my house number is 'challenging'?",
      "a2": "Numbers 4 and 8 are considered challenging but not bad. They require more effort and proper Vastu remedies. You can also add elements to your address (like using 4/1 instead of 4) to shift the energy.",
      "q3": "Should I change my house because of the number?",
      "a3": "Not necessarily. Vastu remedies can significantly improve the energy of any number. Focus on the remedies provided - adding specific colors, symbols, or items in certain directions can balance challenging numbers.",
      "q4": "Does owner compatibility matter?",
      "a4": "Yes, when your Life Path Number harmonizes with your house number, you experience less friction and more natural flow. If incompatible, simple remedies and awareness can help you work with the energy rather than against it."
