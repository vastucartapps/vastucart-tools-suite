            "answer": "Each letter has a numerical value. Adding, removing, or changing even one letter shifts the total, potentially moving you to a more compatible number. A silent 'H' at the start or doubling a vowel can make significant numerological differences while keeping your name recognizable."

            "question": "Should I change my legal name or just how I write it?",
            "answer": "The most important name is the one you use daily - on signatures, social media, business cards. Many people use a numerologically optimized spelling without legally changing their name. However, for maximum effect, using the corrected spelling consistently is recommended."

          "q5": {
            "question": "How long until I see results from a name change?",
            "answer": "Name vibrations work gradually. Most practitioners suggest consistently using your new spelling for at least 90 days before evaluating changes. The effects are subtle - you may notice shifts in how people perceive you, opportunities that arise, or your own mindset."

          "q2": {
            "question": "Should I wear my lucky colors every day?",
            "answer": "You don't need to wear your lucky colors constantly. Use them strategically for important occasions, job interviews, presentations, or when you need extra support. Wearing them on your planetary day (like Sunday for number 1) amplifies their effect."
          },
          "q3": {
            "question": "Why should I avoid certain colors?",
            "answer": "Colors to avoid are associated with planets that are naturally inimical to your ruling planet. While they won't cause harm, they may create subtle friction with your energy. It's best to avoid them for important events."
          },
          "q4": {
            "question": "Can I use lucky colors in home decor?",
            "answer": "Absolutely! Using your lucky colors in home decor creates a harmonious environment. Paint walls, choose curtains, or add accessories in your lucky colors. This creates continuous positive vibrations in your living space."
          },
          "q5": {
            "question": "What if my lucky color doesn't suit my skin tone?",
            "answer": "You don't need to wear the exact shade. Any variation of your lucky color family works - lighter or darker tones, or complementary shades. You can also use the colors in accessories, jewelry, or items you carry."

      "whatIsDescription": "Your Bhagyodaya Year is calculated by combining your Birth Day Number with your Life Path Number. This reveals the age at which your fortune is destined to peak.

      "q2": "How accurate is this calculation?",
      "a2": "The calculations are based on traditional Vedic numerology formulas. While numerology provides valuable guidance, it should be used alongside practical planning. Think of fortune years as times when cosmic support is stronger - but action is still required to manifest results.",
      "q3": "What are Pinnacles and Challenges?",
      "a3": "Pinnacles are four major life phases, each with a specific theme and opportunities. They're calculated from your birth date and Life Path Number. Challenges run parallel to Pinnacles and represent karmic lessons you must learn during each phase. Mastering your current challenge accelerates your growth.",
      "q4": "How should I prepare for my Bhagyodaya Year?",
      "a4": "Build skills and resources in the years leading up to your fortune peak. Clear karmic debts, strengthen relationships, and position yourself for opportunities. During the Bhagyodaya year itself, take bold action, start new ventures, and make major decisions you've been postponing."

      "q4": "Should the starting letter match specific numbers?",
      "a4": "In Pythagorean numerology, each letter has a numerical value. Starting letters set the initial vibration of a name. While not mandatory, choosing a starting letter that corresponds to a favorable number can enhance the name's positive energy."
